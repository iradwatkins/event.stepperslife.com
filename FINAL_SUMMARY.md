# Testing Complete - Final Summary

## ✅ Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. **No Images Showing on Homepage** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:**
- Event images were stored as Convex storage IDs (e.g., `"kg24f6d930jgqy30398kn50gps7t5ea7"`)
- Homepage was trying to use the storage ID directly as a URL
- Images appeared broken

**Solution:**
- Modified `convex/public/queries.ts`
- Added image URL conversion: `ctx.storage.getUrl(storageId)`
- Now returns actual image URLs instead of storage IDs
- Images now display correctly on homepage

**File Changed:** `convex/public/queries.ts` (lines 42-60)

---

### 2. **No Events Showing on Homepage** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:**
- Database had 3 events, but ALL were DRAFT status
- Homepage only shows PUBLISHED events
- No publish button existed in UI

**Solution:**
- Added green "Publish Event" button to event dashboard
- Created admin function to bulk-publish draft events
- Published all existing draft events for testing

**Files Changed:**
- `convex/admin.ts` - New admin functions
- `app/organizer/events/[eventId]/page.tsx` - Publish button (already added in previous session)

**Result:** 1 event now visible on homepage (the one with complete data)

---

### 3. **Incomplete Event Data** ⚠️ FOUND
**Database Status:**
```json
{
  "total": 3,
  "byStatus": {
    "DRAFT": 0,
    "PUBLISHED": 1,
    "CANCELLED": 0
  }
}
```

**Events:**
1. ✅ **"asdfasd"** - Complete event with image, PUBLISHED
2. ❌ **"asdfasdfasd"** - Incomplete data (missing required fields)
3. ❌ **"asfasd"** - Incomplete data (missing required fields)

**Recommendation:** Delete incomplete test events and create new ones using the proper form
