# Event Creation Testing & Fixes

## Issues Found & Fixed

### Issue 1: Events Not Showing on Homepage ✅ FIXED

**Root Cause:**
- Events are created with status `DRAFT` (convex/events/mutations.ts:123)
- Homepage only shows events with status `PUBLISHED` (convex/public/queries.ts:16)
- **NO PUBLISH BUTTON existed in the UI** to change status from DRAFT to PUBLISHED

**Solution:**
Added a "Publish Event" button to the event dashboard page that:
- Only shows when event status is DRAFT
- Calls the `publishEvent` mutation
- Changes event status from DRAFT → PUBLISHED
- Makes the event visible on the homepage

**Files Modified:**
- `app/organizer/events/[eventId]/page.tsx` - Added publish button and handler

**Location:**
The green "Publish Event" button now appears at the top of your event dashboard page next to the Share and Edit buttons.

### Issue 2: Unclear Form Validation Errors ✅ FIXED

**Root Cause:**
When creating an event, if you missed a required field, you got a generic error:
```
"Please fill in all required fields"
```
This didn't tell you WHICH fields were missing!

**Solution:**
Improved validation to show exactly which fields are missing:
```
Please fill in the following required fields:

• Start Date & Time
• City
```

**Files Modified:**
- `app/organizer/events/create/page.tsx` - Enhanced validation messages

**Required Fields:**
1. **Step 1:** Event Name, Description
2. **Step 2:** Start Date & Time
3. **Step 3:** City, State

## How to Test

### Test 1: Create and Publish an Event
1. Go to https://events.stepperslife.com
2. Sign in with Google
3. Click "Create" button
4. Fill out all 4 steps:
   - **Step 1:** Name, Description, Category
   - **Step 2:** **Start Date & Time** (must fill BOTH date AND time)
   - **Step 3:** City, State (required)
   - **Step 4:** Optional details
5. Click "Create Event"
6. You'll be redirected to the event dashboard
7. **Click the green "Publish Event" button**
8. Confirm the publish action
9. Go back to the homepage - **your event should now appear!**

### Test 2: Validation Error Messages
1. Start creating an event
2. Skip Step 2 (don't fill start date)
3. Fill Step 3 (city, state)
4. Try to submit on Step 4
5. You should see: "Please fill in the following required fields: • Start Date & Time"

---

## Common Issues

### "A field needs to be filled out"
This browser validation error appears when:
- The **Start Date & Time** field is empty
- The datetime-local input requires BOTH a date AND time to be selected

**Solution:** Make sure you click the calendar icon AND the clock icon to set both parts.

### Event created but not visible on homepage
**Solution:** Go to your event dashboard (`/organizer/events/[eventId]`) and click the green **"Publish Event"** button.

## Technical Details

### Event Creation Flow
1. User fills form → Creates event with status=DRAFT
2. Event redirects to `/organizer/events/[eventId]/payment-setup`
3. User configures payment (or skips)
4. User returns to event dashboard
5. **User clicks "Publish Event"** → status changes to PUBLISHED
6. Event now appears on homepage

### Database Queries
- `getPublishedEvents` filters by `status === "PUBLISHED"`
- Only published events appear on homepage
- Draft events only visible to organizer in their dashboard

### Validation Logic
```javascript
Required fields:
- eventName (Step 1)
- description (Step 1)
- startDate (Step 2) ← Most commonly missed!
- city (Step 3)
- state (Step 3)
```

---

## Next Steps (Optional Improvements)

1. **Step-by-step validation**: Prevent users from advancing to next step without filling required fields
2. **Real-time validation**: Show red borders on empty required fields
3. **Auto-save drafts**: Save form progress as user fills it out
4. **Better datetime picker**: Use a more user-friendly date/time component
5. **Publish reminder**: Show a banner on draft events reminding user to publish
