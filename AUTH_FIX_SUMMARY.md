## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### **The Core Issue:**

**User sessions existed in NextAuth, but users didn't exist in Convex database!**

**Flow Breakdown:**
```
1. User signs in with Google (or test credentials)
   ↓
2. NextAuth creates session ✅
   ↓
3. Session passed to Convex via ConvexClientProvider ✅
   ↓
4. Convex query: getCurrentUser() runs
   ↓
5. Query searches database for user by email
   ↓
6. ❌ USER NOT FOUND IN DATABASE
   ↓
7. getCurrentUser returns NULL
   ↓
8. Pages show "not authenticated" message
   ↓
9. User appears to be "signed out"
```

**Why Users Weren't in Database:**
- `upsertUserFromAuth` mutation existed
- BUT it was never being called!
- No automatic user creation on sign-in
- Users only existed in NextAuth, not in Convex

## ✅ The Solution

### **Added Automatic User Synchronization**

**File Modified:** `components/convex-client-provider.tsx`

**What Was Added:**
1. **UserSync Component** - Automatically syncs authenticated users to Convex database
2. **Auto-Detection** - Detects when user signs in
3. **Auto-Creation** - Creates user record in Convex database
4. **One-Time Sync** - Uses ref to prevent duplicate creations

**Code Added:**
```typescript
// Auto-sync authenticated user to Convex database
function UserSync() {
  const { data: session, status } = useSession();
  const upsertUser = useMutation(api.users.mutations.upsertUserFromAuth);
  const syncedRef = useRef(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    const syncUser = async () => {
      if (status === "authenticated" && session?.user?.email && !syncedRef.current) {
        try {
          await upsertUser({
            email: session.user.email,
            name: session.user.name || undefined,
            image: session.user.image || undefined,
          });
          syncedRef.current = true;
          console.log("[UserSync] User synced to Convex database:", session.user.email);
        } catch (error) {
          console.error("[UserSync] Failed to sync user:", error);
        }
      } else if (status === "unauthenticated") {
        syncedRef.current = false;
      }
    };

    syncUser();
  }, [status, session, upsertUser]);

  return null;
}
```

**Integration:**
```typescript
function ConvexProviderWithNextAuth({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
  const convex = useMemo(() => new ConvexReactClient(convexUrl), []);

  return (
    <ConvexProviderWithAuth client={convex} useAuth={useNextAuthConvex}>
      <UserSync />  {/* ← Added automatic sync */}
      {children}
    </ConvexProviderWithAuth>
  );
}
```

## 🔄 How It Works Now

### **New Authentication Flow:**
```
1. User signs in with Google (or test credentials)
   ↓
2. NextAuth creates session ✅
   ↓
3. Session passed to Convex ✅
   ↓
4. UserSync component detects authentication ✅
   ↓
5. Automatically calls upsertUserFromAuth mutation ✅
   ↓
6. User record created in Convex database ✅
   ↓
7. getCurrentUser() finds user ✅
   ↓
8. Pages display correctly ✅
```

## 📊 Technical Details

### **Files Modified:**
1. `components/convex-client-provider.tsx`
   - Added `UserSync` component
   - Added `useRef` import
   - Added auto-sync on authentication

### **Database Impact:**
- **Before:** Users existed only in NextAuth sessions
- **After:** Users automatically created in Convex `users` table

### **User Table Structure:**
```typescript
{
  _id: Id<"users">,
  email: string,
  name?: string,
  image?: string,
  role: "user" | "admin",
  emailVerified: boolean,
  createdAt: number,
  updatedAt: number
}
```

## 🔍 Debugging

### **Check if User Was Created:**
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Sign in
3. Look for log: `[UserSync] User synced to Convex database: your@email.com`

### **Verify in Convex Dashboard:**
1. Go to: https://dashboard.convex.dev
2. Select your project
3. Click "Data" tab
4. Click "users" table
5. Search for your email
6. Should see user record with your info

### **If Still Having Issues:**

**Check Console Logs:**
```bash
pm2 logs events-stepperslife
```

**Check Browser Console:**
- Look for `[UserSync]` messages
- Look for errors from Convex queries

**Manual User Creation (if needed):**
```bash
npx convex run users/mutations:upsertUserFromAuth --args '{"email":"your@email.com","name":"Your Name"}'
```
